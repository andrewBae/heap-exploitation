# Introduction

---

Understand memory allocator has been an integral part of heap exploitation.

Allocators has different characterization respectively.

- GNU C Library(glibc) - ptmalloc(pthread malloc - dlmalloc based)
- General-purpose allocator - dlmalloc(Doug Lea's Malloc)
- etc

In this article, I describe memory structure and management mechanism based on ptmalloc.

- ptmalloc activating at more than least two memory area at a time to handle multithreaded applications efficiently.
- When multiple threads invoking `malloc` at the same time, heap segment created on each thread and Arena management that area.
- Therefore, each thread can access own heap without interference.

Application's Arena quantity limit is based on number of cores in the present system.

```c
For 32 bit systems:
     Number of arena = 2 * number of cores.
For 64 bit systems:
     Number of arena = 8 * number of cores.
```
